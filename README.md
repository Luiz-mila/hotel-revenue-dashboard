## 🔍 Key Analyses

### 1️⃣ Revenue by Market Segment
**Business Question:** "Where should we invest our marketing budget?"

**Key Findings:**
- **Online** leads in total revenue ($4,869,836) and ADR ($112.74)
- However, Online also has the **highest cancellation volume** (8,429)
- **Corporate** segment is most reliable (only 220 cancellations) despite lower ADR ($82.91)

**Recommendation:** Implement stricter cancellation policies for Online bookings while offering loyalty incentives to Corporate clients.

---

### 2️⃣ Monthly Revenue Trend
**Business Question:** "When should we increase prices? When to promote?"

**Key Findings:**
- Peak revenue in months **August-October**
- Seasonality pattern suggests non-European destination
- Consistent growth trend across analyzed period

**Recommendation:** Implement dynamic pricing strategy with +15-20% premium during peak months (Aug-Oct).

### 3️⃣ Cancellation Analysis by Lead Time
**Business Question:** "What factors influence cancellations?"

**Key Findings:**

| Booking Window | Cancellation Rate | Strategy |
|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| Very Early (180+ days) | 73.8% ❌ | Non-refundable rate with 20-25% discount |
| Early (90-179 days) | ~45% ⚠️ | Semi-flexible policy |
| Standard (30-89 days) | 25% ⚠️ | Free cancel up to 15 days before |
| Short Notice (7-29 days) | 18% ✅ | Semi-flexible policy |
| Last Minute (0-6 days) | ~10% ✅ | Dynamic pricing premium (+20-30%) |

**Key Insight:** The longer in advance a booking is made, the higher the chance of cancellation. Very Early bookings have a 73.8% cancellation rate despite having the highest volume (5,366 reservations).

---

### 4️⃣ Room Type Performance
**Business Question:** "Which rooms should we invest in? Which to phase out?"

**Key Findings:**

| Room Type | Status | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Type 1** | Cash cow - highest volume (28,063) but low ADR ($93.48) | Test gradual ADR increase (+$5-7) |
| **Type 2** | Underperformer - low volume, low ADR, high cancellation | Phase out or convert |
| **Type 5** | Hidden gem - lowest cancellation (27.2%), good ADR ($118.31) | Increase marketing visibility |
| **Type 6** | Premium opportunity - highest ADR ($178.53) but 42.2% cancellation | Non-refundable rate with perks |
